Although we don't fully understand *how* LLMs work:

1. no complete mechanistic (deterministic input/ouput relationshiop)
   understanding of LLMs due to overparameterization
2. no satisfying theory for adaptive optimization methods like Adam,

formally understanding the *what* of supervised and unsupervised learning is
accessible with PAC and AIXI.
